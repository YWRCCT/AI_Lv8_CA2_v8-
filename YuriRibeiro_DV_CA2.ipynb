    "A - A graph is visual representation of information in a more general graphical form than a tree. It consists of a series of nodes/vertices and edges/links displayed as connections linking the nodes. Graphs can have cycles as a closed loops. While a tree is a general data structure similar to a real tree. It also contains nodes/vertices and edges, however, each node has at most one parent node, and none or more children in a specific order. Thus, a tree cannot have any cycles. (Bullinaria, 2019)"

    "\n",
    "A- Graph structures are useful for modeling and solving various problems. For example, an underground tunnel network or a railway map can be abstractly represented using nodes and edges. By creating a graph for a railway map, it becomes easier to visualize the paths, distances, and obstacles that can hinder progress, making it simpler to generate new ideas and innovations.(Bullinaria, 2019)"
